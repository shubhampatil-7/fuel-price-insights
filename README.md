# Fuel Price Insights

This repository contains the code and data for the Fuel Price Insights project, which aims to analyze historical fuel price trends and forecast future movements using time series Models.

## Overview

The project uses various methods and time series forecasting models, like SARIMA and ARIMA, to predict future fuel prices. The analysis and forecasting are implemented in Python and presented via a Streamlit application.

## Repository Structure

- `TS-proposalP1.pdf` - Proposal for the time series analysis project.
- `TSPart2.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing our whole analysis.
- `app.py` - Streamlit application for interactive data visualization and forecasting.
- `dataset.txt` - Contains the link of the original dataset used for the project.
- `deployed.txt` - Contains the link to the deployed project.
- `requirements.txt` - List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `weekly_fuel_prices_all_data_from_2005_to_20221102-1.csv` - The dataset containing weekly fuel prices from 2005 to November 2022.
